Wall Street Oasis course: Applied Machine Learning Algorithms - Advanced

Data Cleaning & Exploration :
  - Identify and correct errors in categorical variables
  - Identify and correct errors in continuous variables
  - Eliminate sparce classes
  - Visualize distribution with and without outliers
  - Remove unwanted observations from a dataset
  - Identify and eliminate null values in a dataset
  - Visualize distributions by class
  
Liquidity Regressor :
  - Split data into training and testing sets
  - Construct model pipelines
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning
  - Cross-validate alternative models (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor) to find the top performer
  
Investor Classifier I :
  - Understand the business case that is modeled in 'Investor_Classifier_II'
  - Perform more advanced data exploration and visualization
  - Engineer features based on conditional relationships between existing features
  
Investor Classifier II :
  - Use stratified random sampling to select proportionate samples from categorical data
  - Understand the confusion matrix, its relation to the ROC curve and why it is a better success metric than R-squared for classifier algorithms
  - Build and finalize a machine elarning classifier from start to finish
